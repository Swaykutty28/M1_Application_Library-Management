**SWOT ANALYSIS:** 

**STRENGTHS:**

- Simple and Easy to Use.
- Increased Library Engagement.
- Efficient Cloud Data Management.
- Highly Secure, Scalable and Reliable.
- Mobile Access.

**WEAKNESS:**

- The data stored is prone to cyber hacks.
- Costly and Expensive.
- Complicated to operate.
- Risk to computer virus.

**OPPURTUNITIES:**

- This System leaks outward into new spaces, space which it didn’t before, such as reading, lists repositories, learning systems and so on.
- It is likely that the future of library systems will consist of mixture of open and closed system.
- With an increasing move towards closed platforms (e.g., Facebook) libraries will required to navigate these different spaces and ecosystems.

**THREATS:**

- Nowadays, Libraries can easily send and retrieve data from databases for the better invention.
- But, some libraries do not have any rights to data encryption. It leads to lost data.
